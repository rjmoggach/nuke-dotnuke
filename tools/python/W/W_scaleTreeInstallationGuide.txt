W_SCALETREE INSTALLATION GUIDE

1 Copy â€˜W_scaleTree.py' to a folder that's part of the nuke plugin path.
  
2 Append menu.py with the following code:

import W_scaleTree
nuke.menu('Nuke').addCommand('Edit/Node/W_scaleTree', 'W_scaleTree.scaleTreeFloatingPanel()', 'alt+`')

3 Copy the folder called 'icons' to your .nuke folder. If you would rather place the icons elsewhere, make sure to update the path in the python script (line 28).
