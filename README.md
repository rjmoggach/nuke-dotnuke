# python-dotnuke

This is my personal startup environment for nuke.

> These are GUI enhancements that have no impact on rendering. ie. only for my local user

## Usage

This repository should replace your **.nuke ** "dot nuke" folder
in your OS specific location (usually your home folder).


## Background

The ultimate goal should always be to enable the user to be more effective by aspiring to
adhere to the following:
 * always empower users to define their workflow instead of defining it for them
 * build flexible tools that enhance a user's workflow transparently (it should just work)
 * assume custom dependencies will break so fail gracefully
 * mission-critical 'business' logic should be separate from 'convenience' functions
 * changing expected behavior/standards is an 'opt-in' paradigm
 * convenience functions should be separate from mission critical logic and also 'opt-in'

Wherever possible, always keep the following principles in mind without obfuscating the logic
of your code by overly-atomized-abstraction.

## Purpose

The ultimate motive here is to keep the original UI intact to provide
a more fluid user experience instead of surprising changes to expected norms.
As I mentioned above, enhancements should not impact the expected operation of the software
without a user knowing and having the option to opt-in.


## Installation

Easy if you know how. I personally clone it and update it when I need to.
